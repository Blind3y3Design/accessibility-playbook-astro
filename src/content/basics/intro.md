## What is Web Accessibilty?

Accessibility helps disabled people use your products and services. Unfortunately, many websites are not designed and built properly, that makes them difficult or impossible for some people to use.

Web accessibility opens up your products and services to many more individuals, which in turn is good for business. International web standards define what you need to do for accessibility.

### Why Accessibility is Important

- Accessibility improves user experience for disabled people, older people, and people who use older devices.
- At some point in their life, [everyone will experience a (temporary) disability](https://www.perpendicularangel.com/portfolio/publications/published-on-the-pastry-box/an-alphabet-of-accessibility-issues/).
- Accessibility is a [legal requirement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) in many countries.
- [At least 15% of the worldâ€™s population has a recognized disability.](https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/statistics/who-disability.php) Accessibility opens up your services to this market.
