The equality act makes it illegal to discriminate against various groups, including people living with disabilities.

In The Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations [WCAG 2.1 is specifically referenced as a compliance threshold (PDF)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/pdfs/uksiem_20180952_en.pdf) that must be met by covered entities.
