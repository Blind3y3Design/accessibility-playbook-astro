Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This means that users must be able to understand the information being presented; it canâ€™t be invisible to any of their senses.

**Perceivable Guideline Example:** Text Alternatives. Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, translations, or simpler language.
