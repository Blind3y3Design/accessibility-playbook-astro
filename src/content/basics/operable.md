User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means that users must be able to use the interface and it cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform.

**Operable Guideline Example:** Keyboard Accessible. Make all functionality available from a keyboard or a keyboard interface so that people with disabilities are able to operate websites without needing a mouse.
