Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 is developed through the [W3C process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/) in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.

The prevailing standard for many years was WCAG 2.0, originally published in 2008.

The current best practice is to follow the guidelines set forth in the updated WCAG 2.1, originally published in 2018.

The upcoming WCAG 2.2 standard is set to be published in August 2023.
