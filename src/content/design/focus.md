All interactive elements on a page should be able to receive keyboard focus. Make sure that you design what it looks like when these elements receive focus. Just as you would design mouse over states, design focus states.

Never remove the browser default focus outline unless you designed an accessible alternative (with a contrast ratio of 3:1).
