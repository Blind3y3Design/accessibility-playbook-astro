From left to right and top to bottom is the default (for people who read from left to right) and usually the way to go for tab order. But when interfaces become more complex, this becomes something to think about.

Is the ”close button” the first or the last element in a (modal) window? Do submenus in a navigation menu open when the top-level menu-item receives focus? And does the user have to tab through all the submenu-items or can they skip directly to the next top-level item?

For keyboard users this is a huge part of the interaction, so keep this in mind for your designs.
