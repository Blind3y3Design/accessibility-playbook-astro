People who use keyboard navigation (or other ways of sequential navigation) to go through a page, often come across lists of interactive elements that they need to go through before they get to the content they want to read. A common example is the navigationmenu at the top of a page.

You can allow users to skip these blocks by including a “Skip link” at the top of the page which links directly to the main content. This link can be hidden by default but should become visible when it receives keyboard focus.

This technique can also be used for other components that contain lots of interactive elements, like carousels.
