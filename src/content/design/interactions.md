Think of functionality like a collapsible navigation menu. This functionality should not only expand on mouseover, but also when it receives keyboard focus. Also think of the affordances for keyboard users.

Particularly tricky components can be drag-and-drop interfaces or other components that require a user to make a path-based gesture (for example requiring people to sign a document using a mouse or trackpad).
