Elements that are repeated across a website should be identified consistently. This goes for text content, but also for non-text content, like icons.

This makes the website familiar and predictable for your users. In particular those with cognitive limitations, users with low vision, users with intellectual disabilities, and blind users.

When they learn functionality on one page, they can more easily find them on other pages.
