Make sure that thereâ€™s enough color contrast in your designs; the contrast ratio between a text and its background should be at least 4.5:1. This helps low vision users in particular.

There is an exception for large or bold text. Text that is larger than 24px or bold text that is larger than 18px should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

There are plenty of tools available to check the color contrast in your designs.
