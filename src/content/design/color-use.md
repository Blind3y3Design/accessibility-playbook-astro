Using color to communicate information that is important to the user is fine, as long as you also use another way to communicate the information.

Examples of this are marking erroneous form fields with a red border alone, or a red or green dot to indicate a status. The form fields should also have an icon, a text, or something else that tells the user that something's wrong. And the status dot could also be a red cross and a green checkmark.

This way people with limited color vision can also see everything they need to know.
