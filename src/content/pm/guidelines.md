Make sure you know what accessibility is and where to find the guidelines.

Most of accessibility is covered by the international WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standard. Get familiar with the guidelines and what it means to make your products "accessible".

Read the guidelines and one of the many articles and books that cover accessibility, or follow an online course.
