If you want to do accessibility right, you need to bake it in to your process. Not as a backlog item or a fix afterwards, but in the Definition of Done.

Make sure to put tests in place throughout the project, just as you would for performance testing or browser-compatibility.

Automated tests are a good start, but they only cover about 30% of all the criteria. And you need to check the results for false positives and false negatives. Youâ€™ll also need to do manual testing and involve disabled people in your design process.
